<!-- 
HTML is loaded and evaluated by browser
AngularJS is loaded and executed, creating the angular global object
javascript that creates the myApp module and registers the homeController function is executed
Angular scans html looking for apps and views, if a view is found, connects the view with the specified controller function
AngularJS executes the controller functions and updates the view with the data from the model populated by the controller.
Displys pages and Angular listens for browsers events like mouseover and click and if any of these events require a view changes Angular updates the view as needed.

controller - business logic behind views
data binding - cynchronizes data between the model and the view
dependency injection - creates and wires objects and functions
directives - extend html with custom attributes and elements
expressions access variables and functions from the scope
filter - formats the value of an expression for display to the user.
injector - dependency injection container
model - the model is the data shown to the user in the view and with which the user interacts
module - a container for the different parts of an app including controllers, services, filters, an directives which configure the injector
scope - the context where the model is store so that controllers, directives, and expressions can access it, ties the view to the controller
view - what the user sees
service, a reusable business logic which is independent of views
template - html with additional markup
