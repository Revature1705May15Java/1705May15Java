			<div id="Login">
				<h3>Login Screen</h3>
				<p>If the user selects the log in option, they are prompted for an email. If they enter an email that is not in the database, they are taken back to the initial menu. Otherwise, they are prompted for their password.</p>
				<img src="images/loginScreen.png" alt="Screenshot of login screen">
				<p>If the user enters an incorrect password three times, the program will terminate. This behavior is used to simulate a user being locked out of their account for too many failed login attempts in a short amount of time.</p>
				<p>A successful login will take the user to the <a href="#UserMenu">user menu</a>.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="NewMember">
				<h3>New Member Screen</h3>
				<p>Users that are not members of the bank can easily sign up. They need only provide a unique email address, their name, and a password. New users are added to the "Users" table of the database.</p>

				<p>After successfully becoming a member of the bank, new users will be taken to the <a href="#UserMenu">user menu</a>.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="Exit">
				<h3>Exit Program</h3>
				<p>Users can also choose to exit the program. Upon choosing this option, all open resources are closed and the user is presented a friendly message.</p>
