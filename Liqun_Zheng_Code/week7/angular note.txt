ANGULARJS:
- compiler - a compiler parses the template and instantiates the directives and expressions
- controller - the business logic behind views 
- data binding - sychronizes data between the model and the views
- dependecy injection - creates and wires objects and functions
- directives - extends HTML with custom attributes and elements
- expressions - access variables and functions from the scope
- filter - formats the value of an expression for display to the user. 
used after |
- injector - a dependency injection container
- model - the model is the data shown to the user in the view and with which the user interacts
- module - a module is a container for the different parts of an 
app including controllers, services, filters, and directives which configures the injector
- scope - the scope is the context where the model is stored so that controllers, directives, and exressions can access it (this ties the view to controllers!!)
- view - the view is ultimately what the user sees
- service - a service is reusable business logic which is independent of views 
- template - HTML with additional markup
