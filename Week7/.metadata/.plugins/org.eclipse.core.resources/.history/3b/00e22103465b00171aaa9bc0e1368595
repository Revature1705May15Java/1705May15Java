<!-- 
- HTML is loaded and evaluated by the browser
- AngularJS is loaded and executed, creating the angular global object
- the JS that creates the myApp module and registers the HomeController
function is executed 
- angular scans html looking for apps and views. if AJS finds a view, 
it connects that view with the specified controller function
- AJS executes the controller functions and updates the views with the data
from the model populated by the controller. 
- At this point, the HTML page is ready to be displayed
- AJS now listens for the browser events such as mouseover or click. If any of
these events were to require a view chanage, AJS will update the view accordingly
