Hello all, 

This is a really simple sort of "Hello World" project, intro
to SOAP. We set this up by creating a cxf-jaxws-javafirst maven project
Steps to do so:
1. New maven project
2. do not click create simple project, we will be selecting an archetype
3. type in cxf and if nothing shows up you must import the archetype directory
	- to do this, Window > Preferences > Maven > Archetypes > Add Remote Catalog >
	paste the following link https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/archetype-catalog.xml
	in the catelog file input, and give a simple name to description
	apply, try again to give the archetype cxf-jaxws-javafirst to maven project
4. name it the same way as we typically do with our maven projects
5. run project on server via web.xml, make sure server is started and synchronized
