/*
 * @Entity, labels class as an entity. Unless we explicitly give it the param(name="x"), 
 * when writing HQL or JPQL we will use the name of the class to refer to this entity, 
 * if we do label the entity with a name, we will refer to it with that name
 * 
 * @Table gives a name to the table in the database
 * 
 * @Inheritance - defines the inheritance strategy to be used for an entity class
 * hierarchy. It is specified on the entity class that is the root of the hierarchy
 * If the @Inheritance annotation is not specified or if no inheritance type is 
 * specified for an entity class hierarchy, the SINGLE_TABLE mapping strategy is used
 * 
 * InheritanceType enum:
 * 	- JOINED - a strategy in which fields that are specific to a subclass are mapped to 
 * a separate table than the fields that are common to the parent class, and a join 
 * is performed to instantiate the subclass
 * - SINGLE_TABLE - a single table per class hierarchy
 * - TABLE_PER_CLASS - a table per concrete entity class
 * 
 * --> We don't have an inheritance tree here but thought I'd detail the possibilities
