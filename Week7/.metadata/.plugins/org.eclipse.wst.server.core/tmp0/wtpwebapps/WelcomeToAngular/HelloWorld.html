<!-- STEPS to get a basic angular app started

1. start with your basic HTML app, and add the AngularJS library to the script 
2. Add the ng-app directive.
Add this attribute to the body element
to indicate what part of the HTML page contains the
AngularJS application 
3. The view: 
in this example, the view is  the <div> element and everything inside it. The 
div element contains the controller attribute specifying a controller (JS function)
named HelloController
Also, within the <h1> element there is a <h1> element there is an angular 
expression (which is specified using {{ }} ). The expression is telling angular
to insert the model value named message into the HTML at that location 
4. Add a Module and a Controller : the myapp module and the HomeController function
must be specified. The HomeController is simply a regular JS function. In AngularJS, 
it is registered using angular.module1(...).controller(...)
The angular object is a global object created by the angular framework 



// Here's what is happening when the app is run in the browser:
- HTML is loaded and evaluated by browser
- AngularJS file is loaded and executed, creating the angular global object
- the JS that creates the "myApp" module and registers the "HomeController" 
controller function is executed
- angular scans html looking for apps and views. If AJS finds a view, it connects 
that view to the specified controller function 
- AJS executes tthe controller functions and updates the vews with data
from the model populated by the controller. At this poing, the HTML page is 
ready to be displayed
- AJS now listens for browser events (ie mousemovement, clicks). If any of the 
events would require a view to change, AJS will update the view accordingly
