<!-- 
-HTML is loaded and evaluated by the browser
-AngularJS is loaded and executed, creating the angular global object
-the JS that creates the myApp module and registers the HomeController function is executed
-Angular scans HTML looking for apps and views. If AJS finds a view, it connects
	that view with the specified controller function
-AJS executes the controller functions and updates the views with the data from the model 
	populated by the controller.
-At this point, the HTML page is ready to be displayed
-AJS now listens for the browser evens such as mouseover or click. If any of these events were
	to require a view change, AJS will update the view accordingly.
