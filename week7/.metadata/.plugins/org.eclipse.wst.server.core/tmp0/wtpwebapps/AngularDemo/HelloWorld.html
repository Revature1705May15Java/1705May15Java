<!-- 
-HTML is loaded and evaluated by the browser
-AngularJS is loaded and executed, creating the angular global object
-the JS that creates the myApp module and registers the HomeController function is executed
-Angular scans HTML looking for apps and views. If AJS finds a view, it connects
	that view with the specified controller function
-AJS executes the controller functions and updates the views with the data from the model 
	populated by the controller.
-At this point, the HTML page is ready to be displayed
-AJS now listens for the browser evens such as mouseover or click. If any of these events were
	to require a view change, AJS will update the view accordingly.
	
****************************VOCABULARY
-compiler: a compiler parses the template and instantiates the directives and expressions
-controller: the business logic behind views
-data binding: synchronizes data between the model and the view
-dependency injection: creates and wires objects and functions
-directives: extends HTML with custom attributes and elements
-expressions: access variables and functions from the scope
-filter: formats the value of an expression for display to the user, used after |
-injector: a dependency injection container
-model: the model is the data shown to the user in the view and with which the user interacts
-module: a module is a container for the different parts of an app including controllers, 
	services, filters and directives which configures the injector
-scope: the scope is the context where the model is stored so that controllers, 
	directives, and expressions can access it (this ties the view to controllers)
-view: the view is ultimately what the user sees
-service: the service is reusable business logic which is independent of views
-template: HTML with additional markup
